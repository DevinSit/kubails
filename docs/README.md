description: What is Kubails?

# Introduction

**Kubails** is a highly opinionated framework for enabling rapid deployment and prototyping of Docker-based web services.

That is, if you're developing a web app, **Kubails** makes a bunch of tooling and infrastructure decisions for you so that you can get your app deployed in **less than an hour**. Then you can start iterating quickly while being supported by modern development comforts like **repeatable environments**, **true CI/CD**, and **per branch deployments**.

So if this sounds like the sort of thing that would be helpful for your project, then try out Kubails and get to building _now_.

If you have any questions about the project, feel free to check the [FAQ](./FAQ.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Kubails is still **alpha** software.

While the underlying technologies are mostly production-ready, using Kubails for production projects is certainly at **your own risk**!
{% endhint %}

## Features

* **Fast initial setup**: Get deployed and developing in less than an hour.
* **Opinionated project architecture**: Worry less about deciding between one person's cloud or another.
* **Robust infrastructure management**: With Terraform and Helm, everything is just configuration as code.
* **Centralized configuration**: `kubails.json` is your entrypoint to keeping Terraform, Helm, and everything else in sync.
* **Scale as you grow**: By the power of _The Cloudâ„¢_ and Kubernetes, you can scale as much as you have money.
* **Modern developer experience**: Between Docker and per branch deployments, you can be sure that what works in one place works everywhere.
