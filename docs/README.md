description: What is Kubails?

# Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
	Kubails is still **alpha** software. 

 	While the underlying technologies are certainly production-class, using Kubails for production projects is certainly at **your own risk**!
{% endhint %}

**Kubails** is a highly opinionated framework for enabling rapid deployment and prototyping of Docker-based web services. 

That is, if you're developing a web app, **Kubails** makes a bunch of tooling and infrastructure decisions for you so that you can get your app deployed in **less than an hour**. Then you can start iterating quickly while being supported by modern development comforts like **true CI/CD** and **per branch deployments**.

Ultimately, **Kubails** is a CLI tool that wraps together many technologies like **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, and **Google Cloud Platform**. It removes the drudgery of manually configuring all these tools to work together so that you focus more on product development than DevOps.

So if this sounds like the sort of thing that would be helpful for your project, then make your project a **Kubails Project** and get to building your product _now_.
