description: What is Kubails?

# Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
Kubails is still **alpha** software. 

While the underlying technologies are mostly production-ready, using Kubails for production projects is certainly at **your own risk**!
{% endhint %}

**Kubails** is a highly opinionated framework for enabling rapid deployment and prototyping of Docker-based web services. 

That is, if you're developing a web app, **Kubails** makes a bunch of tooling and infrastructure decisions for you so that you can get your app deployed in **less than an hour**. Then you can start iterating quickly while being supported by modern development comforts like **true CI/CD** and **per branch deployments**.

So if this sounds like the sort of thing that would be helpful for your project, then make your project a **Kubails Project** and get to building _now_.

If you have any questions about the project, feel free to check the [FAQ](#TODO).

## Features

- **Fast initial setup**: Get deployed and developing in less than an hour.
- **Opinionated project architecture**: All the decisions for infrastructure, pipelines, dep 
- **Robust infrastructure management**: With Terraform and Helm, everything is just configuration as code.
- **Scale as you grow**: With the power of _The Cloudâ„¢_ and Kubernetes, you can scale as much as you have money.
- **Modern developer experience**: Between Docker and per branch deployments, you can be sure that what works in one place works everywhere.

## Get Started

## Learn about Kubails

While Kubails makes a lot of decisions for you and tries to automate away a lot of the drudgery, that doesn't mean you shouldn't understand the underlying concepts and technologies.

The docs are structured to explain each piece of Kubails and what technologies are used to make it happen.
