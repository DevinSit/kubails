description: You probably shouldn't use Kubails.
---

As much as I'd love for everyone to be using Kubails, it is **far more realistic** for me to say that you probably _shouldn't_ be using Kubails.

**Here's why**.

And if you haven't already, I suggest going through the [Introduction](./README.md) and the [FAQ](./FAQ.md) to learn more about _what_ Kubails is.

# It's a one man project

Hi! It's me! The one person creating/maintaining Kubails.

**This has its implications.** One person only has so much time for maintenance, support, etc.

As such, if you think you'll need support outside of what the documentation offers (and outside what could be answered through some GitHub issues), then I suggest you use a managed PaaS.

# It's still pretty alpha

As much as _I've_ been using Kubails for several projects (some of which have been going for a while now) doesn't mean _I_ have the utmost confidence to say that anyone else should use it. If only because it's **never been tested under a true production load**.

Kubails really was designed to fit my personal needs for bootstrapping projects, so I don't think it's a point where I'm confident enough to say that "yes, this'll fit your needs too".

# You don't want to use Docker/Kubernetes/GCP/etc

Obviously, if you don't _want_ to use/learn the underlying technologies, there's no point in you using Kubails.

# You want to use AWS

As I outlined in the [FAQ](./FAQ.md#aww-come-on-i-really-want-to-use-aws-instead-of-gcp), **AWS support is not currently in the works**. As such, you must assume that it'll never.

So... yeah, don't use Kubails if _must_ use AWS.
